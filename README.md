# 🐿️ Squirrel Framework

> Hybrid audio-first toolkit that mixes Vanilla JS + Squirrel UI DSL, a Node/Fastify toolchain, and a Rust/Tauri runtime to target web, desktop,mobile and even and AUv3 hosts with a single codebase.

## Overview

Squirrel provides a declarative UI DSL (expressed as plain JavaScript) that drives custom components and drag‑and‑drop workflows. The desktop shell is powered by Tauri 2, which embeds both a Rust (Axum) micro server and the Node/Fastify stack so that the same `/api/uploads` and static assets work across dev servers, packaged apps, and AUv3 extensions. A shared iPlug2 pipeline keeps the DSP core consistent between AUv3 and WebAudio Module (WAM) builds.

## Architecture at a glance

| Layer | Purpose | Default ports / paths |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Squirrel Frontend** (`src/application`) | Builds views via `$()` helpers, handles drag/drop, WaveSurfer timelines, and DSL-generated components. | Runs inside the browser, the Tauri webview, or WKWebView for AUv3. |
| **Fastify server** (`server/server.js`) | Serves static files during development, exposes `/api/uploads` backed by `src/assets/uploads`, proxies DB access (PostgreSQL via Objection/Knex). | `http://127.0.0.1:3001` |
| **Axum server in Tauri** (`src-tauri/src/server`) | Mirrors the same API when the app runs inside Tauri, persisting uploads under the sandbox (`~/Library/Containers/.../uploads`). | `http://127.0.0.1:3000` |
| **Tauri host** (`src-tauri`) | Launches the Axum server, makes sure Fastify is running (spawning it if needed), and exposes the port to the frontend. | Native desktop bundle. |
| **DSP / AUv3 / WAM** (`src/core`, `src/au`, `src/web`, `src-Auv3`) | Shared C++ DSP core compiled via the root CMake superbuild, surfaced either as an AUv3 (iPlug2) or as a WebAudio Module bridge. | Depends on the chosen target. |

## Key capabilities

- **Declarative UI DSL** – Build interfaces entirely in JS using Squirrel selectors (no raw HTML/CSS edits).
- **Drag & drop uploads** – `src/application/aBox/index.js` streams blobs to `/api/uploads`, refreshes metadata, and offers one-click downloads.
- **Multi-runtime parity** – Fastify (Node) and Axum (Rust) implement the same endpoints, so Tauri/AUv3 and the browser stay aligned.
- **Audio tooling** – WaveSurfer components, GSAP animations, Tone.js helpers, and the shared iPlug2 DSP core.
- **Automation scripts** – `run.sh` installs deps, configures PostgreSQL DSNs, launches Fastify + Tauri, or builds production bundles.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Rust toolchain + `@tauri-apps/cli`
- macOS toolchain for AUv3 (Xcode 15+, Command Line Tools, codesigning identities)
- CMake + Ninja/Make for the DSP superbuild
- PostgreSQL (optional, needed for features hitting Objection/Knex) – `run.sh` writes a default DSN to `.env`
- `brew install ripgrep` is convenient for searching (optional)

## Getting started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Run only the Fastify backend (dev web)

```bash
npm run start:server
```

This serves `src/` at `http://127.0.0.1:3001`, exposes `/api/uploads`, and uses `src/assets/uploads` as the storage root.

### 3. Launch only the Tauri shell

```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

Tauri embeds the Axum server on port `3000`, points the webview to the same `src/` assets, and spawns Fastify if it is not already running.

### 4. Orchestrated workflow

```bash
./run.sh              # installs deps (if needed), starts Fastify + Tauri
./run.sh --force-deps # forces dependency reinstall before launch
./run.sh --prod       # builds frontend + tauri bundle, mounts the dmg
```

`run.sh` also ensures `ADOLE_PG_DSN` (or equivalent) exists by generating `postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/squirrel` when nothing is configured.

### 5. Production bundles & packages

```bash
npm run build          # rollup build for npm package
npm run build:cdn      # minimized UMD bundle for CDN
npm run build:all      # npm + CDN builds
npm run tauri build    # production desktop bundle (also invoked by ./run.sh --prod)
```

### 6. Tests & utilities

```bash
npm run test           # vitest
npm run scan:components
npm run check:syntax
```

## Upload workflow

1. `DragDrop.createDropZone` in `src/application/aBox/index.js` collects dropped files.
2. Each file is sent as `application/octet-stream` with an `X-Filename` header to `/api/uploads`.
3. The server (Fastify or Axum) sanitizes the filename, resolves collisions, writes to disk, and responds with `{ success: true, file }`.
4. `fetchUploadsMetadata` polls `/api/uploads` to rebuild the list; clicking an entry triggers `/api/uploads/:file` for download.

> **Storage paths**
>
> - **Fastify (Node)**: saves under `src/assets/uploads` relative to the repo root.
> - **Tauri/Axum**: saves under the app’s sandbox (`~/Library/Containers/.../uploads`). When the UI runs inside AUv3 or the packaged app, inspect that path instead of the repo folder.

## DSL ⇄ Rust ⇄ JavaScript pipeline

- The DSL authoring style mirrors `box`, `text`, and other primitives (`documentations/using_squirrel.md`).
- `src-tauri/src/server/mod.rs` demonstrates how nodes are parsed, sanitized, and exposed to the frontend.
- The Rust snippet below shows the simplified data flow used in the docs:

```rust
pub fn parse_dsl() -> Vec<String> {
    let mut node = Node::new("note", "text");
    node.set("content", json!("✎ Edit me inline"));
    node.set("editable", json!(true));
    vec![node.to_js()]
}
```

The generated JS is still plain ES modules and ends up calling helpers like `createNode` or `$()` so it can run unchanged whether the app is embedded in a browser, in Tauri, or inside the AUv3 WebView.

## Audio plugins, AUv3, and WAM

- The root `CMakeLists.txt` builds shared targets: `dsp_core`, `ring_buffer`, `disk_reader`.
- `src/au` exposes the DSP parameters to iPlug2; `src/web` exposes the same graph to a WebAudio Module stub, and `src-Auv3/iplug/AUViewController.swift` renders the Squirrel UI via WKWebView.
- `auv3.sh`, `build_PWA_app.sh`, and `scripts_utils/run_fastify.sh`/`run_tauri.sh` automate packaging for each runtime.
- Known limitations (see `Problems solving/`): disk streaming is a placeholder, time-stretch hooks exist but need concrete implementations, and the WAM glue is still minimal.

## Documentation & references

Keep the README in sync with these guides when the build, runtime ports, or upload behavior change.# 🐿️ Squirrel Framework

- Swift WKWebView bridge in `src-Auv3/iplug/AUViewController.swift` using `squirrel` message channel.

Build notes

- Desktop (skeleton): configure with CMake to build `dsp_core`, `atome_au` (Apple), `atome_wam` (with Emscripten when `-DATOME_BUILD_WAM=ON`).
- iOS/macOS AUv3: integrate CMake targets into Xcode project or build an xcframework. AU view is provided by `AUViewController.swift`.
- Web WAM: build with emsdk toolchain; UI is `src/web/app.js` (Squirrel-style JS) controlling parameters only.

Limitations (Step 1)

- DiskReader generates silence placeholder; replace with AVAudioFile/AVAssetReader on Apple.
- No time-stretch yet; hook is in `DSPCore::processTimeStretch`.

Next steps

- Implement Apple disk decoding, WAM node glue, and Xcode wiring.
