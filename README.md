# Specification for a Hybrid Development System (DSL + Rust + JS)

## Objective

Create a development environment combining the flexibility of a simple, elegant, and practical scripting language, the performance of Rust, and the simplicity of a user interface built in JavaScript.

## Main Components

### 1. **DSL (Domain-Specific Language)**

* **Elegant scripting language**: Inspired by the simplicity and power of dynamic languages, offering advanced features such as:

  * **Simple hash tables**: Intuitive data collections.
  * **Dynamic methods**: Ability to define methods at runtime (`define_method`), check message responses (`respond_to?`), and inspect objects (`inspect`).
  * **Metaprogramming**: Modify the behavior of objects and classes dynamically.

### 2. **JavaScript Generation**

* **DSL Compilation**: Code written in the DSL is automatically translated into pure JavaScript for manipulating the user interface, ensuring maximum responsiveness.

### 3. **Rust Backend**

* **Heavy operations**: Complex operations and intensive computations are handled by Rust modules compiled to native code for optimal performance.
* **API Interface**: An API facilitates communication between the JavaScript frontend and the Rust backend for critical processing.

### 4. **Interoperability**

* **Smooth communication**: A high-performance mechanism exchanges data between JS (UI) and Rust (backend) with minimal latency.
* **Optional WebAssembly**: Possibility to use WebAssembly for Rust parts when needed, while limiting its use to avoid performance loss.

## Summary of Advantages

* **Performance**: Rust handles critical tasks, JavaScript manages the UI—resulting in high overall performance.
* **Flexibility**: The scripting language enables intuitive, powerful code with advanced metaprogramming capabilities.
* **Interoperability**: A performant bridge between frontend and backend leverages each technology’s strengths.

## Minimal DSL Example (Editable Text Inline, Events, Metaprogramming)

```text
page = box(id: :main, width: :full, height: :full, attach: :body)

note = text(id: :note,
			content: "✎ Edit me inline",
			editable: true,         # maps to contenteditable
			draggable: true,
			left: 88,
			top: 88,
			style: { font_size: 20, color: :blue })

note.on(:key_down) do |e|
  puts "Key: #{e[:key]}"
end

note.define_method(:highlight) do
  self[:color] = :red
end

note.instance_var_write(:saved_text, "Initial value")

puts note.instance_var_read(:saved_text)        # -> "Initial value"
puts note.respond_to?(:highlight)               # -> true
puts note.inspect                               # -> full DSL object dump

page.add(note)
```
