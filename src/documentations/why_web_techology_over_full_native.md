# Why Web Technology Over Full Native

## Introduction

This document summarizes the key reasons behind choosing a web-based technology stack (Elegant DSL + Rust + Tauri) instead of going with a fully native application stack (Swift, Kotlin, C++, etc.). The decision was made based on performance, flexibility, long-term sustainability, and ease of development—especially in the context of AI-generated code and reactive UI paradigms.

## 1. Ecosystem Compatibility and Future Trends

✅ **AI-Centric Development**
AI code generation tools (e.g., Copilot, ChatGPT, v0.dev) overwhelmingly favor web technologies like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This trend ensures better alignment with future development practices where AI will generate or co-pilot much of the code.

✅ **Regulatory Shifts**
Recent regulatory actions (EU DMA, antitrust pressure) are forcing companies like Apple to support PWAs, push notifications, and web standards more openly. This makes the web increasingly powerful and less restricted than before.

✅ **Platform Neutrality**
Web applications run across all major platforms (macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, and Web). Native apps require separate builds and platform-specific logic, which multiplies development and maintenance costs.

## 2. Performance and Technical Architecture

✅ **Rust + Tauri = Native Speed**
Tauri lets us build desktop apps using web UI (HTML/JS/DSL) while delegating backend logic to Rust.
Unlike WASM-based UIs, we avoid bridging performance-critical rendering code to the DOM.
Instead, we let JavaScript handle all UI updates natively, and use Rust via Tauri commands for heavy backend logic.
This gives us the best balance between speed, simplicity, and developer control.

⚠️ **Note**: We deliberately avoid using WebAssembly to control the DOM or layout.
It’s excellent for compute tasks, but not ideal for UI responsiveness and ergonomics.

✅ **High-Performance Native Code**
Rust handles CPU-intensive tasks (parsing, computation, I/O, image/audio processing) with:

* Memory safety and performance on par with C/C++
* Near-zero runtime overhead
* Clean API interfaces for invoking from JS (via Tauri or FFI)

## 3. Development Speed and Maintainability

✅ **Hot Reload and Modular Design**
The web stack allows real-time editing, hot reloading, and easy inspection in the browser or WebView.

✅ **Elegant DSL for UI Logic**
We use a minimal, declarative scripting language that compiles to JavaScript. It is expressive, compact, and readable—perfect for designing UI without heavy frameworks or JSX.

✅ **Simpler Tooling**
Using standard JavaScript and HTML/CSS tools, we avoid complex native SDKs and platform constraints. There's no need for Xcode, Android Studio, or platform-specific toolchains to build UI.

## 4. Progressive Enhancement

✅ **Reactive Layer is Optional**
We start with a simple imperative DOM-based rendering system. A reactive signal/state layer can be added incrementally, without refactoring existing code, thanks to clean separation between state and view.

---

## 5. Philosophy and Control

✅ **Total Control Over the Stack**
By building our own rendering engine and reactive system, we retain full control over performance, structure, and behavior. We don’t rely on external libraries like React, Vue, or JSX-based abstractions unless strictly needed.

✅ **No JSX, No Magic**
UI is defined with clean, human-readable code. Everything is introspectable, dynamically modifiable, and fast to iterate on.

## Conclusion

Web technologies have matured dramatically and now offer:

* Native-level performance (via Rust + Tauri)
* Cross-platform compatibility
* Flexibility in development style
* AI-friendly code generation
* Reduced complexity and tooling overhead

By combining an elegant DSL for UI logic, Rust for core processing, and Tauri for packaging, we achieve the best of both worlds: modern, reactive, and maintainable applications without compromising on speed, responsiveness, or control.
